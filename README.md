# docker-compose-images
Collection of docker compose images that I am using for prototyping and studies.

Make sure that you have [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and 
[Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) installed and up to date.

Navigate to a sub folder project where there's a docker compose file with .yml extension(usually docker-compose.yml)
and `docker-compose up`

Have fun
